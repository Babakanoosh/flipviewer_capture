# flipviewer_capture
Autoit Version: v3.3.16.1

Created to capture flipviewer pages to BMP. (can also just be used to capture up to two boxed areas on the screen)

Set the top left and bottom right coordinate of the page capture area then start capturing.
Hide the cursor area magnifier to reduce program lag.
The files will be saved and the page number will go up by 1 for every page captured.
Uncheck a page box if it is not going to be captured.


How the screen coordinates are defined: X is horizonal and Y is vertical and the point of origin is the top left of the screen.
